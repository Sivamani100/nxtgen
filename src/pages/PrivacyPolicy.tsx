    title: "1. Foreword - Our Commitment",
    paragraphs: [
      "Welcome to the NXTGEN App Privacy Policy. This document reflects our unwavering commitment to user data security, digital rights, and transparent technology in student guidance ecosystems. NXTGEN is built to empower individuals with knowledge, tools, and pathways while fiercely protecting your private information throughout your journey. Every feature, module, and backend process in our app is architected with privacy-first engineering. You'll discover in this policy how we exceed industry requirements and proactively anticipate your needs as education and technology evolve."

    title: "2. About NXTGEN",
    paragraphs: [
      "NXTGEN is a pioneering educational guidance platform designed specifically for India's dynamic academic landscape. Our service aggregates diverse data sources, connects thousands of students with colleges, and provides personalized guidance using modern AI algorithms. This policy is as dynamic as our platform, and as you read on, you'll discover how seriously we take trust—every line of code, data pipeline, and analytics dashboard is audited for your privacy.",
      "We only collect what is absolutely essential to provide best-in-class services, never more. Every new feature goes through rigorous privacy review and user consent workflow."
    ],
  },
  {
    title: "3. Data We Process: Voluntary and Required",
    paragraphs: [
      "NXTGEN processes a vast array of data to serve your needs: from academic records, EAMCET results, to behavioral analytics for progress tracking. Our data collection is always justified with a legitimate educational purpose. None of your information is sold or given to external advertisers. Instead, it helps us optimize and personalize your application experience."
    ],
  },
  {
    title: "4. Information Collection Methods",
    paragraphs: [
      "You willingly provide us data through onboarding, profile completion, academic uploads, FAQ inquiries, shared reviews or participation in chat features. We may also collect system data—e.g., device type, app version, crash logs, or IP for authentication. Each method is logged for accountability, periodically reviewed, and scoped to its specific function."
    ],
  },
  {
    title: "5. Justification for Each Data Field",
    paragraphs: [
      "Every field in our sign-up, feedback, and engagement flow is there for a reason—student support or compliance. For instance, your phone number enables secure account recovery, while scores enable tailored preparation programs. We never ask for sensitive biometrics, financial data (unless for secure payments), or government documents unless strictly mandated."
    ],
  },
  {
    title: "6. Data Integrity and Verification",
    paragraphs: [
      "We implement automated and manual checks to guarantee the accuracy of your information. Our system notifies you in case of ambiguities or outliers so you can make corrections. All changes require user authentication and are server-logged for future audit.",
      "Data tampering, impersonation, fraudulent records or attempts to breach academic integrity are detected and handled with immediate account suspension, following strict protocols."
    ],
  },
  {
    title: "7. Encryption at All Layers",
    paragraphs: [
      "Your data is protected in transit and at rest using TLS, HTTPS, and state-of-the-art cryptographic standards. No plain-text passwords or tokens are ever stored. Internal employee dashboards use multi-factor authentication while our AI routines are sandboxed from raw data."
    ],
  },
  {
    title: "8. Advanced Consent Workflows",
    paragraphs: [
      "We prioritize granular user consent across the entire app. Features like profile sharing, leaderboard visibility, and college comparison are opt-in, not opt-out. You choose what profile info to display to peers or colleges. Consent logs are downloadable and exportable on request."
    ],
  },
  {
    title: "9. AI Transparency and Human Oversight",
    paragraphs: [
      "All predictive features in NXTGEN—college match, cutoff predictors, and news ranking—are clearly labeled and explained. AI-generated recommendations never result in irreversible decisions and are always subject to human review in case of disputes. You can appeal or challenge automated outcomes directly within the app."
    ],
  },
  {
    title: "10. Cross-border Storage and Regional Data Centers",
    paragraphs: [
      "We host your data primarily within Indian and US-based compliant data centers. Backups and logs are redundantly distributed with regular audits. If you are outside India, you can request location-specific hosting or data transfer summaries for added assurance."
    ],
  },
  {
    title: "11. Marketing Communications and Opt-out Options",
    paragraphs: [
      "We only send marketing or campaign content after explicit opt-in. Transactional, security, and essential onboarding content are always delivered. Promotional preferences are respected in real-time, and unsubscribing from any newsletter is just one click away."
    ],
  },
  {
    title: "12. User Control and Data Retention Timelines",
    paragraphs: [
      "Your control extends to every byte in our system. Via the profile dashboard, you may export, rectify, or erase most personal data (exceptions: anti-fraud, audit duty, or ongoing disputes). Data linked solely to your account is deleted within seven business days of confirmed erasure requests; anonymized logs may be retained for research."
    ],
  },
  {
    title: "13. Deletion and Portability Procedures",
    paragraphs: [
      "Requesting erasure is simple: go to Settings > Privacy and follow the guided steps. We send you a final downloadable copy of allowed records, confirm deletion, and notify any third parties that process your data on our behalf. Porting your data to another service uses secure channels only, with validation tokens to thwart man-in-the-middle attacks."
    ],
  },
  {
    title: "14. Legal Compliance & Government Requests",
    paragraphs: [
      "NXTGEN complies with Indian data laws (IT Act, 2021 amendments), international frameworks (GDPR, CCPA), and all legitimate court requests. Any non-urgent government demand triggers a prompt notification and, if possible, gives you a chance to contest."
    ],
  },
  {
    title: "15. Incident Handling and Disaster Recovery",
    paragraphs: [
      "In the rare event of a breach, we activate our incident response: user notifications within 48 hours, forensic audits, and platform lockdowns if necessary. Restoration of access follows phased re-authentication, and you always receive a detailed cause and prevention report."
    ],
  },
  {
    title: "16. Third-Party Integrations (Vendors & SDKs)",
    paragraphs: [
      "All integrations—authentication, analytics, customer support—are reviewed annually, and providers must comply with our robust Data Processing Agreements. Vendors never receive more data than absolutely necessary, and each integration is sandboxed for minimal risk."
    ],
  },
  {
    title: "17. Community and Public Forums",
    paragraphs: [
      "Engagement in NXTGEN's community spaces, forums, or peer chat features is always optional. You decide what information is displayed, can edit or remove content at any point, and can flag interactions for moderation. Our community guidelines are enforced vigilantly to prevent harassment."
    ],
  },
  {
    title: "18. Parental Controls & Underage Users",
    paragraphs: [
      "We restrict features for users under 18 and require parental/guardian consent for those under 15. Parents can request detailed reports on their child’s account, trigger immediate lockdowns, or request deletion of all trace data."
    ],
  },
  {
    title: "19. Audit Logs & Transparency Reports",
    paragraphs: [
      "All internal access, API changes, and user-triggered security events are tracked with cryptographic audit trails. We publish biannual transparency reports summarizing requests, type of data accessed, and law enforcement queries."
    ],
  },
  {
    title: "20. User Responsibilities and Netiquette",
    paragraphs: [
      "While NXTGEN takes extraordinary measures for your safety, we expect responsible behavior: choose secure passwords, do not share credentials, and promptly report suspicious activity. Violations of our Acceptable Use Policy may result in warnings or permanent bans."
    ],
  },
  {
    title: "21. Research, Product Iteration & Data Science",
    paragraphs: [
      "For product improvement, NXTGEN may anonymize and analyze trends in how students engage with guidance features, resources, or content feeds. None of this analysis is traced back to uniquely-identifiable users, and no third party receives unredacted data."
    ],
  },
  {
    title: "22. Global Operations, Local Laws, and Language Access",
    paragraphs: [
      "Our privacy protocols adapt to the legal landscape of each user’s region. Should new privacy laws emerge, we’ll notify and adapt beforehand. Our policies and notifications are available in major Indian languages and English to ensure accessibility."
    ],
  },
  {
    title: "23. Notification of Changes to This Policy",
    paragraphs: [
      "When we update this Privacy Policy, changes are highlighted at the top of this page with a summary, and the effective date is updated. Major changes are also broadcast via notification banners and email. Continued use after notification implies acceptance, but you can always opt out or request more information."
